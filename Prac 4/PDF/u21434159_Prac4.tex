\subsection*{Task 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.1 #3]The error produced by the program is an Arithmetic exception at line 19. The function arguments were a=-2, b=0.
    \item[1.1 #5]The error occurs in the \textit{improve} function that is called by the main function at line 13.
    \item[1.1 #8]\textit{highest} = 0
    \item[1.1 #9]The error occurs because the \textit{improve} function is called with the arguments \textit{a}=-2 and \textit{highest}=0. This causes a division by 0. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.2 #3]Process ID: 2175
    \item[1.2 #4]Invalid write of size 4.
    \item[1.2 #5]It tells me that the error comes from the \textit{capture} method at line 4 which is called by the \textit{main} method at line 9.
    \item[1.2 #6]An integer is 4 bytes long and an array of 10 integers has not been freed. Therefore 40 bytes have been lost.
    \item[1.2 #7]I would deallocate the integer array that is created in the \textit{capture} method at line 3.
\end{itemize}
